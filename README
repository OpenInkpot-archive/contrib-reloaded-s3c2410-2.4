This Linux 2.4 module aims to do basically the same thing
as kexec - lets you load a new kernel from a running one.

To build it you have to point the 'linux' symlink to configured
sources for your platform and set the right cross-compiling
environment in the Makefile. 'make reloaded.o' should do the
rest.
